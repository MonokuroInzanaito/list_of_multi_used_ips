# list_of_multi_used_ips
The list of IP addresses which were used by more than one player, suspected to have joined YGOCore League Tournament with more than one identity.
Note: This list is just to show how mess YGOCore League is, and may not by accurate. This list is not for providing who they really are to the YGOCore League Administrators. To protect those players, some digits of their IP addresses are hidden. And I DO NOT undertake any risk for any abuse of this list.
